Currents
=========

Within QBlade three different types of time constant currents may be defined. An overview of the available types of currents is given below.

- Near Surface Currents (constant shear profile): Definition of velocity, direction and depth
- Sub Surface Currents (power law profile): Definition of Velocity, direction and shear exponent
- Near Shore Currents (constant): Definition of Velocity and direction

Any combination of these types of currents and/or waves may be included within a QBlade simulation. In all cases the velocities at each evaluation 
point are evaluated as a superposition of all contributions from waves and currents. A complete hydroelastic representation of the turbine also requires 
accounting for fluid-structure interaction. This topic is covered in Sections :ref:`Linear Potential Flow Theory` and :ref:`Morison Equation`.
