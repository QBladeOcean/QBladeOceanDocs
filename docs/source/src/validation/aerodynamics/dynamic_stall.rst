Validation of the ATEFlap Dynamic Stall Model
==============================================


Two exemplary validation graphs for the :doc:`../../theory/aerodynamics/dynamic_stall/ATEFLAP_stall` from the publication by Wendler et al. :footcite:`Wendler2016` are shown in :numref:`fig-vali1`, where the general sensitivity of the dynamic stall hysteresis loop to the reduced frequency and amplitude is well reproduced.
