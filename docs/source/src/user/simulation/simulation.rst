To define a simulation of a turbine object several simulation parameters and boundary conditions need to be defined. The following list gives an overview:

* Simulation length & time step size
* Structural solver
* Wind boundary conditions
* Wave & current boundary conditions
* Environmental parameters: density, gravity, etc.

Simulations can either be defined through the turbine simulation dialog, or directly by creating or modifying simulation definition (``.sim``) files.

Simulation Definition
=====================

Setting up a simulation in QBlade is handled through the dialog shown below:

Below, an overview of the different dialog sections and each editable parameters is given. If you are looking for a specific parameter from the dialog it is suggested to use the search function of the documentation to find it quickly. Also note that each of the parameters described in the following has an equivalent keyword within the :ref:`Simulation Definition ASCII File`.
   
General Simulation Settings
---------------------------

* **Name of Simulation**: A unique name to identify the simulation object
* **Timestep Size / Azimuthal Step**: Both values are interconnected through the turbine **RPM** setting
* **Number of Timesteps / Simulation Length**: Both values are interconnected through the **TimestepSize** setting
* **Store Replay**: A replay of the simulation is created by storing all position and wake data for every timestep. 

Structural Model Initialization
-------------------------------

These field are only editable if the selected turbine object has a structural model definition.

* **Ramp-Up Time**: The (structural) simulation is ramped-up over the specified time. This part of the simulation does not generate data and is not stored.
* **Initial Overdamp. Time**: For the specified time the model Rayleigh damping is increased by the factor **Overdamp. Factor**. If the value is 0 the *overdamping* is active during ramp-up, any negative value disables *overdamping* of the model.
* **Overdamp. Factor**: During the *overdamping* time all model damping values are increased by this factor.


Wind Boundary Condition
-----------------------

* **Wind Input Type**: Sets the wind input type. Options are :ref:`Uniform Wind Field`, :ref:`Turbulent Wind Field` and :ref:`Hub Height File`.
* **Turbulent Windfields**: In this *ComboBox* all Windfields that are stored in the database are listed.
* **Turbulent Windfield Object**: These buttons allow to generate a new Windfield or to edit an existing one.
* **Turbulent Windfield Shift**: The currently selected Windfield may be shifted in time (to start at another time than t=0s), if *Auto* is chosen the Windfield is shifted by the rotor diameter divided by the mean freestream velocity to fully immerse the rotor at the start of a simulation..
* **Turbulent Windfield Stitching**: If the simulation time is larger than the Windfield length the Windfield is either repeated (*Periodic*) or mirrored (*Mirror*) at the end of its timeseries.
* **Aerodyn Hub Height File**: This enables to load a hub height file from the file system to be assigned to this simulation.
* **Windspeed**: Set the windspeed if **Wind Input Type** is set to *Uniform*.
* **Vert. Inflow Angle**: Set the vertical inflow angle if **Wind Input Type** is either *Uniform* or *Turbulent Field*.
* **Horiz. Inflow Angle**: Set the horizontal inflow angle if **Wind Input Type** is either *Uniform* or *Turbulent Field*.
* **Wind Shear Type**: Set the windshear type if the wind input type is *Uniform* or the turbulent windfield is imported.
* **Power Law Exponent**: Set the Coefficient for a **Power Law** wind profile.
* **Roughness Length**: Set the **Roughness Length** for a *Log* Profile..
* **Reference Height**: Set the **Reference Height** for the wind profiles.
* **Directional Shear**: Set a directional shear. The shear is assumed to be 0.0 at the **Reference Height**.
* **Include Ground Effects**: Interludes the modelling of **Ground Effects**, see :ref:`Ground Effect`.

Turbine Setup
-------------

* **Name of Turbine**: Define a name for the turbine simulation object.
* **Use Turbine Definition**: Use the selected *turbine definition* object from the data base in this simulation object.
* **Global Position (X,Y,Z)**: Set the global position of the wind turbine for this simulation.
* **Global Rotation (X,Y,Z)**: Set the global rotation of the wind turbine for this simulation. In the case of a floating turbine being simulated the global rotation also rotates the mooring line connections to the ground.

Rotational Speed Settings
-------------------------

* **RPM / TSR**: Both values are interconnected through the rotor size and current windspeed.

The following options are related to the RPM control for this simulation. For *turbine definition* object without a structural definition the *RPM* is always constant if no **Simulation Input File** is defined. For *turbine definition* objects with a structural definition the following options are avaliable:

* **Ramp-Up Fixed**: The *RPM* is fixed only during the ramp-up time of the simulation so that when the simulation starts the rotor is operating at the chosen RPM. During the simulation time the rotor rotation is governed by the balance of aerodynamic- and generator torque. This is the recommended setting for simulations that contain a *Controller*.
* **Always Fixed**: The *RPM* is fixed for the total duration of the simulation to the chosen *RPM*.
* **Free**: For *ramp-up* and simulation time the rotor rotation is governed by the balance of aerodynamic- and generator torque. 

Turbine Initial Conditions
--------------------------

* **Azimuth, Yaw, Col. Pitch**: Sets the initial azimuthal rotor angle, yaw angle and collective pitch angle for the simulation.

Floater Initial Conditions
--------------------------
These edits are only enabled if a wind turbine with a floating substructure is simulated. The initial floater conditions can be used to setup decay tests for specific DOF's or to place the floater closer to its final equilibrium position to speed-up initial transients.

* **X, Y, Z Translation**: Sets the initial displacement for the floater.
* **Roll, Pitch, Yaw**: Sets the initial rotation of the floater.

Structural Simulation Settings
------------------------------

* **Structural Steps / Aerostep**: Sets how many structural steps will be evaluated per global timestep. If multiple structural steps are evaluated per global timestep the aerodynamic loading is assumed to be constant.
* **Initial Relaxation Steps**: An initial iterative relaxation is performed, taking into account only gravitational forces.
* **Number of Iterations**: Set the number of iterations for the *iterative* time steppers, such as the **HHT**.
* **Include Aero Forces & Moments**: Toggles if aerodynamic forces are projected onto  the structural model definition.
* **Include Hydro Forces & Moments**: Toggles if hydrodynamic forces are projected onto  the structural model definition.

Turbine Events and Operation
----------------------------

In this section special events, external loading, prescribed motion and prescribed operation can be defined for a *turbine definition*. Below exemplary files are shown for each file type:

Event Definition File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An event is defined by a combination of *Keywords* and values. The following list gives an overview of the available event types. Events can only be defined if the turbine definition has a structural definition. Multiple events may be defined in a single file. The events override any events / control that is returned via the controller exchange array:

	* **30 FAILGRID**: At time 30 s, the generator moment is set to 0 Nm.
	* **30 SETBRAKE**: At time 30 s, the brake is engaged.
	* **30 1.5 FAILPITCH_1**: At time 30 s, the pitch rate of blade nr. 1 is set to a maximum rate of 1.5 deg/s
	* **30 90 1.5 PITCHTO**: At time 30 s, the collective pitch rate is set to 1.5deg/s until 90 deg are reached.
	* **30 90 1.5 YAWTO**: At time 30 s, the yaw rate is set to 1.5deg/s until 90 deg are reached.
	* **30 FAILBLADE_1**: At time 30 s, blade nr. 1 is *released* from the hub, by deactivating the respective structural constraint.
	* **30 FAILCAB_1**: At time 30 s, the cable with the CABID 1 is removed.
	* **30 FAILMOO_1**: At time 30 s, the mooring line with the MOOID 1 is removed.
	* **30 FAILCST_1**: At time 30 s, the constraint with the CSTID 1 is deactivated.
	
The events **FAILMOO** and **FAILCST** may also be defined in the :ref:`Multi Turbine Global Mooring System` file. If defined there, these events are applied onto the mooring lines or constraints of the shared mooring system.

External Loading File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user defined loading timeseries can be applied to the turbine during simulation via this file format, multiple loading timeseries may be appended into a single file. The nomenclature in the file is as follows:

.. code-block:: console
	:caption: : The scheme of an external loading file

	<SensorName> <localflag>
	<time1> <fx1> <fy1> <fz1> <mx1> <my1> <mz1>
	<time2> <fx2> <fy2> <fz2> <mx2> <my2> <mz2>
	
Sensor naming is the same as in the main file for the sensor outputs (see :ref:`Loading Data and Sensor Locations`) The local flag (local, global) defined if the loads are applied in the :ref:`Global Coordinate System` or in the :ref:`Local Body Coordinate Systems` or :ref:`Local Sensor Coordinate Systems`. QBlade interpolates linearly the loads between time stamps. External load time series for multiple sensors can be appended into a single file.

Furthermore, the user can specify the following *<SensorNames>* to which the loading will be applied:

 * **HUB**: The load will be applied to the hub, in the rotating hub coordinate system.
 * **HUBFIXED**: The load will be applied to the hub, in the nonrotating hub coordinate system.
 * **GENERATOR**: The **<mx>** torque will be applied to the generator side of the drivetrain, all other force components (<fx> <fy> <fz> <my> <mz>) are ignored.

This exemplary file applies an impulsive load of 1e7 N along the global x-direction to the tower at 50% height. The loads are interpolated in time, so the x-loading rises from 0 N at 19.8s linearly to 1e7 N at 20s and drops of to 0 N at 20.2s:

.. code-block:: console
	:caption: : An exemplary external loading file that applies an impulsive load at 20s to the tower

	TWR_0.5	false	
	19.8	0	0	0	0	0	0	
	20	1e8	0	0	0	0	0	
	20.2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Simulation Input File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The turbine operation can be prescribed using a file of the following format. *Turbine definition* with or without a structural definition can be subjected to prescribed operation. QBlade interpolates linearly the loads between time stamps.

.. code-block:: console
	:caption: : An exemplary simulation input file

	50	11	11	0	40	...	40	0	0	...	0


Prescribed Motion File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The translation and rotation of the ground, where the tower bottom of the wind turbine is constrained, can be prescribed using a prescribed motion file of the following format. The translation and rotation is applied to the "ground" to which a bottom fixed turbine is directly connected. 

If a **floating wind turbine** is simulated the prescribed motion will only affect elements that are constrained to the seabed (typically the mooring line anchors). By using the keyword **FIXEDFLOATER** (see :ref:`Miscellaneous Substructure Parameters`) in the turbine substructure definition it is also possible to prescribe the translation/rotation of the floater directly.

.. code-block:: console
	:caption: : An exemplary prescribed motion file

	Time	TransX	TransY	TransZ	RotX	RotY	RotZ
	0	1	11	0	0	0	0

-------------------------
.. admonition:: QBlade-EE

   This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of QBlade.
   
If enabled multiple turbines may be added to a single simulation object and their wake interaction can be evaluated. Find more information in the section :ref:`Multi Turbine Simulation Setup`.

Turbine Environment
-------------------

* **Installation**: The user can chose between *Offshore* and *Onshore* installation. If *Offshore* is selected the user must also specify the water depth.
* **Water Depth**: Sets the water depth for an offshore simulation.

------------------------
These edits are only enabled if *Offshore* installation is selected.

* **Wave Type**: Toggles if a linear wave should be included in the simulation.
* **Kinematic Stretching**: Choose the :ref:`Kinematic Stretching` type if a linear wave is selected.
* **Linear Wave**: A wave from QBlades database can be selected.

* **Sub Surf: U, Dir, Exp**: Sets velocity, direction and exponent parameters for **Sub Surface Currents**, see :ref:`Currents`.
* **Near Shore: U, Dir**: Sets velocity and direction for **Near Shore Currents**, see :ref:`Currents`.

Environmental Variables

* **Gravity**
* **Air Density**
* **Kinematic Viscosity (Air)**
* **Water Density**
* **Kinematic Viscosity (Water)**

Seabed Modelling
----------------

To prevent the mooring lines from penetrating the seabed, the seabed is modelled as vertically oriented spring/dampers that act on the mooring line elements that are in contact with the seabed. The model implemented is highly similar to the work of :footcite:t:`Hall2017`.

* **Seabed Stiffness**: The spring stiffness coefficient for the seabed model (acting in the vertical direction only).
* **Seabed Damping Factor**: The seabed damping coefficient, as a fraction of the spring stiffness coefficient (acting in the vertical direction only).
* **Seabed Fraction Factor**: The seabed fraction coefficient for the seabed model, as a fraction of the spring stiffness coefficient (acting in the horizontal direction, opposite to the direction of line movement, only).


Stored Simulation Data
----------------------

The user can choose here to only store a certain type of simulation data (to limit the project file or data export size. Furthermore, the user can choose to store simulation data only after a certain time has passed, to remove transients from the datasets.

* **Store Output From**: Simulation Data is only stored after the defined simulation time has passed.
* **Store Aero Time Data**: Toggles if this data type is stored. (All data that is shown in the *Aerodynamic Time Graph*).
* **Store Aero Blade Data**: Toggles if this data type is stored. (All data that is shown in the *Aerodynamic Blade Graph*).
* **Store Structural Data**: Toggles if this data type is stored. (All data that is shown in the *Structural Time Graph*).

* **Store DWM Wake Data**: Toggles if this data type is stored. (All data that is shown in the *DWM Graph*).

VPML Particle Remeshing
-----------------------

.. admonition:: QBlade-EE

   This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of QBlade.
   
Free wake filaments may be converted into vortex particles. The following parameters govern the treatment of free vortex particles during a simulation.

* **Remeshing Scheme**
* **Remesh Update After X Steps**
* **Base Grid Size**
* **Particle Core Size Factor**
* **Magnitude Filter Factor**
* **Max. Stretch Factor**


Modal Analysis
--------------

.. admonition:: QBlade-EE

   This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of QBlade.
   
When activated, a modal analysis is performed at the end of the simulation. This process linearizes the mass, stiffness, and damping matrices around the turbine's operating point. Aerodynamic forces are included as a Jacobian matrix, and geometric stiffness effects are added if enabled in the wind turbine definition. A generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) is then set up and solved. The modal analysis is carried out after the end of the simulation, when the rotor reaches its initial azimuthal position, facilitating the comparison of mode shapes across different operating points, such as for generating automated Campbell Diagrams.

* **Perform Modal Analysis at end**: Toggles if a modal analysis is performed at the end of the simulation.
* **Search From Min. Freq.**: Only modeshapes with an Eigen frequency above this value are stored.
* **Delta Freq.**: Only modeshapes that are spaced apart by this value are stored.
* **Number Modes**: The number of modes (starting from the lowest frequency) that will be stored.

When a model analysis has successfully been conducted, the modeshapes can be inspected in the GUI (see :numref:`fig-modal2`). For this purpose the currently visualized modeshape can be changed in the *Modal Analysis Dock Window* (see :numref:`fig-modal1`). In the menu the currently displayed mode can be changed (**Number**). Furthermore, the amplification of the mode shape (**Amp**), and the scaling of the rotational modal displacements, in relation to the translational modal displacements, can be set (**R.Scale**). Lastly, it is also possible to plot the Real, Imaginary, Magnitude of Phase of the mode (**Show**).

Dynamic Wake Meandering
-----------------------

Here the user can choose which wake summation method shall be applied to overlapping wakes of the :ref:`Dynamic Wake Meandering Model`. The different options are:

* **Dominant Wake**: The combined wake velocity is equal to the velocity of the wake with the largest velocity deficit (induction)
* **Sum of Squares**: The wake induced velocities are summed up by the sum of squares method.
* **Vector Sum**: The wake induced velocities are summed up by linear vector addition.


Ice Throw Simulation
--------------------

.. admonition:: QBlade-EE

   This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of QBlade.
   
A simulation of ice throw, shed from the rotor, can be performed in QBlade, see :footcite:t:`Lennie2019`. The following parameters govern the range of the randomized uniform distributions of ice particle properties. The distribution of *landed* ice particles can then be exported to generate iso-risk contours for the localized individual risk (*LIRA*) of a person being hit by an ice throw event.

* **Simulate Ice Throw**: Toggles if an Ice Throw Simulation is carried out.
* **Min. / Max. Drag**: Sets the range of drag values for the generated ice particles.
* **Min. / Max. Mass**: Set the range of masses for the generated ice particles.
* **Min. / Max. Density**: Set the range of density for the generated ice particles.
* **Min. / Max. Radius**: Set the range of ice particle release positions (in % of rotor radius).
* **Total N Particles**: Set the total number of ice particles that are generated during the simulation. This number will be evenly distributed over all timesteps of the simulation.

Simulation Definition ASCII File
--------------------------------

Simulation objects can be exported into the text based ``.sim`` format. When a simulation object is exported into the ``.sim`` format, the associated turbine ``.trb`` file is automatically generated and exported. See an exemplary ``.sim`` file below:
