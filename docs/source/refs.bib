This diameter may be obtained from models of non-cavitating vortices that describe the radial distribution of the azimuthal velocity, for given vortex strength and size of the viscous core. The present paper discusses several vortex models that suit this purpose and compares the distribution of the azimuthal velocity as well as that of the pressure with detailed experimental data for the tip vortex of a rectangular wing obtained from literature.},

@article{Moriarty2005,
abstract = {AeroDyn is a set of routines used in conjunction with an aeroelastic simulation code to predict the aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbines. These subroutines provide several different models whose theoretical bases are described in this manual. AeroDyn contains two models for calculating the effect of wind turbine wakes: the blade element momentum theory and the generalized dynamic-wake theory. Blade element momentum theory is the classical standard used by many wind turbine designers and generalized dynamic wake theory is a more recent model useful for modeling skewed and unsteady wake dynamics. When using the blade element momentum theory, various corrections are available for the user, such as incorporating the aerodynamic effects of tip losses, hub losses, and skewed wakes. With the generalized dynamic wake, all of these effects are automatically included. Both of these methods are used to calculate the axial induced velocities from the wake in the rotor plane. The user also has the option of calculating the rotational induced velocity. In addition, AeroDyn contains an important model for dynamic stall based on the semi-empirical Beddoes-Leishman model. This model is particularly important for yawed wind turbines. Another aerodynamic model in AeroDyn is a tower shadow model based on potential flow around a cylinder and an expanding wake. Finally, AeroDyn has the ability to read several different formats of wind input, including single-point hub-height wind files or multiple-point turbulent winds. i},

abstract = {A method is presented which allows the computation of air load coefficients for rotor blade sections at attached and separated flow conditions, including leading effects of blade rotation. The method consists of an existing computer code for 2D unsteady flow with strong viscous-inviscid interaction, in which the turbulent boundary layer integral method has been modified by including leading terms for steady 3D effects on a high aspect ratio rotating blade. A summary is presented of the approach made, and a first set of results are compared with wind-tunnel data for a wind-turbine model. Computed 2D polars and corresponding pressure distributions for a non-rotating and rotating blade section appear to be qualitatively similar to experimental data, including high values of the lift coefficient measured at 30{\%} of the tip radius. For sufficient accuracy in practice, however, various aspects of the method need further analysis and improvement.},

abstract = { When modeling wind turbine wake recovery, the location of wake breakdown plays a crucial role. The breakdown is caused by a rapid deformation of the helical near-wake vortex structure that is triggered by the pairing of successive blade tip vortices. In this paper, the capability of a cost-efficient lifting-line free vortex wake code to accurately predict the wake breakdown location and its underlying mechanisms is demonstrated and validated against simulation results of a large-eddy simulation solver and additional data from the literature. Furthermore, this work investigates a technique to accelerate the breakdown of wind turbine wakes. The onset of wake breakdown is caused by perturbations that travel along the helical structure of the wake and grow via mutual-induction interaction between neighboring vortex filaments. To accelerate wake breakdown, the blade tip vortices are perturbed at different frequencies via trailing-edge flaps located in the outboard region of the rotor blades. Through the evaluation of the perturbation growth rates and the analysis of velocity fields, it is shown that for a multi-megawatt wind turbine operating in a turbulent wind field, the wake breakdown position can be significantly affected by a moderate flap actuation amplitude if excited at an appropriate frequency. }

@article{Balduzzi2017b,
abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 ASME. Due to the rapid progress in high-performance computing and the availability of increasingly large computational resources, Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) now offers a cost-effective, versatile and accurate means to improve the understanding of the unsteady aerodynamics of Darrieus wind turbines and deliver more efficient designs. In particular, the possibility of determining a fully resolved flow field past the blades by means of CFD offers the opportunity to both further understand the physics underlying the turbine fluid dynamics and to use this knowledge to validate lower-order models, which can have a wider diffusion in the wind energy sector, particularly for industrial use, in the light of their lower computational burden. In this context, highly spatially and temporally refined timedependent three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations were carried out using more than 16,000 processor cores per simulation on an IBM BG/Q cluster in order to investigate thoroughly the three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics of a single blade in Darrieus-like motion. Particular attention was payed to tip losses, dynamic stall, and blade/wake interaction. CFD results are compared with those obtained with an opensource code based on the Lifting Line Free Vortex Wake Model (LLFVW). At present, this approach is the most refined method among the "lower-fidelity" models and, as the wake is explicitly resolved in contrast to BEM-based methods, LLFVW analyses provide three-dimensional flow solutions. Extended comparisons between the two approaches are presented and a critical analysis is carried out to identify the benefits and drawbacks of the two approaches.},
