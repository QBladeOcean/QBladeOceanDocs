abstract = {An important input parameter for a recently developed semi-empirical prediction method for the noise generated by cavitating vortices is the diameter of the cavitating vortex. This diameter may be obtained from models of non-cavitating vortices that describe the radial distribution of the azimuthal velocity, for given vortex strength and size of the viscous core. The present paper discusses several vortex models that suit this purpose and compares the distribution of the azimuthal velocity as well as that of the pressure with detailed experimental data for the tip vortex of a rectangular wing obtained from literature.},

@article{Moriarty2005,
abstract = {AeroDyn is a set of routines used in conjunction with an aeroelastic simulation code to predict the aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbines. These subroutines provide several different models whose theoretical bases are described in this manual. AeroDyn contains two models for calculating the effect of wind turbine wakes: the blade element momentum theory and the generalized dynamic-wake theory. Blade element momentum theory is the classical standard used by many wind turbine designers and generalized dynamic wake theory is a more recent model useful for modeling skewed and unsteady wake dynamics. When using the blade element momentum theory, various corrections are available for the user, such as incorporating the aerodynamic effects of tip losses, hub losses, and skewed wakes. With the generalized dynamic wake, all of these effects are automatically included. Both of these methods are used to calculate the axial induced velocities from the wake in the rotor plane. The user also has the option of calculating the rotational induced velocity. In addition, AeroDyn contains an important model for dynamic stall based on the semi-empirical Beddoes-Leishman model. This model is particularly important for yawed wind turbines. Another aerodynamic model in AeroDyn is a tower shadow model based on potential flow around a cylinder and an expanding wake. Finally, AeroDyn has the ability to read several different formats of wind input, including single-point hub-height wind files or multiple-point turbulent winds. i},

The study has three objectives. The first one is the provision of validation data. The second one is to estimate the influence of the wind tunnel walls by comparing measurements to simulated results with and without wind tunnel walls. The last objective is the comparison and evaluation of methods of high fidelity, namely computational fluid dynamics, and medium fidelity, namely lifting-line free vortex wake. The experiments were carried out in the large wind tunnel of the TU Berlin where a blockage ratio of 40{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%} occurs. With the lifting-line free vortex wake code QBlade, the turbine was simulated under far field conditions at the TU Berlin.

abstract = {A method is presented which allows the computation of air load coefficients for rotor blade sections at attached and separated flow conditions, including leading effects of blade rotation. The method consists of an existing computer code for 2D unsteady flow with strong viscous-inviscid interaction, in which the turbulent boundary layer integral method has been modified by including leading terms for steady 3D effects on a high aspect ratio rotating blade. A summary is presented of the approach made, and a first set of results are compared with wind-tunnel data for a wind-turbine model. Computed 2D polars and corresponding pressure distributions for a non-rotating and rotating blade section appear to be qualitatively similar to experimental data, including high values of the lift coefficient measured at 30{\%} of the tip radius. For sufficient accuracy in practice, however, various aspects of the method need further analysis and improvement.},
