@article{Hommes2015,
abstract = {An important input parameter for a recently developed semi-empirical prediction method for the noise generated by cavitating vortices is the diameter of the cavitating vortex. This diameter may be obtained from models of non-cavitating vortices that describe the radial distribution of the azimuthal velocity, for given vortex strength and size of the viscous core. The present paper discusses several vortex models that suit this purpose and compares the distribution of the azimuthal velocity as well as that of the pressure with detailed experimental data for the tip vortex of a rectangular wing obtained from literature.},
