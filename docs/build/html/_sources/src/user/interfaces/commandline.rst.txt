CLI Overview
************

.. admonition:: QBlade-EE

   This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of QBlade.
   
QBlade-EE can also be executed in a command line interface (CLI). The main purpose of QBlade's CLI is to batch-process large sets of simulations in parallel while reducing any computational overhead from the GUI. When processing large sets of simulations a single instance of QBlade will act as the *thread manager*, in charge of creating new QBlade instances for each simulation that is evaluated and queuing these simulations over all available threads. This approach has the advantage of being highly robust, as if one simulation crashes for any reason it wont affect any other simulation and the batch run will still complete without the need for user intervention. This section details the functionality of the QBlade CLI and its options. 

To start QBlade in CLI mode simply call QBlade's executable from a command window while adding the parameter :code:`-cmd` to indicate that instead of starting QBlade in GUI mode it will be operated in CLI mode. 

:code:`QBladeEE -cmd`
	
If the command above is executed, QBlade prints out the following information on the screen::

Since no options have been passed in this example of executing the CLI, the program is exiting without any actions. However, some useful information has already been printed on screen. This includes the **OpenCL Devices** as they have been detected by QBlade and the total number of **CPU Cores** that could be found on the machine. This information is useful when evaluating large sets of simulations to inform QBlade which OpenCL device to use and how many simulations should be evaluated in parallel.
	
The available functionality of the QBlade CLI can be viewed by adding :code:`help` (note that the minus sign is not required when adding the :code:`help` command, while it is mandatory when adding :code:`-cmd`).

:code:`QBladeEE -cmd help`
	
This command prints out an overview of all CLI functionality::

CLI Options
***********

In this section the different CLI options are briefly explained.

	**-d**

This parameter is used to specify on which OpenCL device QBlade should be executed. The default value is 0. To execute on the OpenCL device 1, the parameter would be :code:`-d1`.

	**-g**

This parameter specifies the OpenCL work-group size, which has a GPU dependent impact on the OpenCL performance. The work-group size should always be a power of 2. The default value is 32. To specify a work-group size of 64 you would pass the parameter :code:`-g64`.  

	**-t**

This parameter sets how many parallel instances of QBlade should be started when evaluating a batch of simulations. The default values is 1. To specify 12 parallel threads you would pass the parameter :code:`-t12`.

	**\\directory\\simulation.sim**
	
Passing the absolute location of a :ref:`Simulation Definition ASCII File` (\*.sim) as one of the parameters adds this simulation definition to the list of simulations that will be evaluated. Finished simulation definitions are stored as **.qpr1**, to indicate that these are project files that have already been evaluated. Should a simulation fail for any reason the associated project is stored as ***.qpre** instead, to indicate that this is a problematic simulation. :code:`\\directory\\project.qpr`.

	**\\directory\\project.qpr**

Passing the absolute location of a QBlade Project File (\*.qpr) adds all simulation definitions within this project to the list of simulations that will be evaluated. Finished project files are stored as ***.qpr1**,  to indicate that these are project files that have already been evaluated. Should a simulation fail for any reason the associated project is stored as ***.qpre** instead, to indicate that this is a problematic simulation. :code:`\\directory\\project.qpr`.

	**\\directory\\cutplane.cut**
	
When passing the absolute location of a cut-pLane definition (\*.cut) this Cut-Plane Definition is added to the list of cut-plane definitions that will be calculated for all simulations that are evaluated. :code:`\\directory\\cutplane.cut`.

	**\\directory\\**
	
Passing the absolute path of any directory adds this directory to the list of working directories (**WORKING_DIR**). :code:`\\directory\\`.

	**all_sim**
	
Adding the parameter :code:`all_sim` causes QBlade to add **all \*.sim files from all WORKING_DIR(s)** to the list of simulations that will be evaluated.

	**all_qpr**
	
Adding the parameter :code:`all_qpr` causes QBlade to add **all \*.qpr files from to all WORKING_DIR(s)** to the list of projects that will be evaluated.

	**all_cut**
	
Adding the parameter :code:`all_cut` causes QBlade to add **all \*.cut files from to all WORKING_DIR(s)** to the list of cut-plane definitions that will be calculated for all simulations that are evaluated.

	**no_save**
	
The parameter :code:`no_save` prevents QBlade from automatically storing finished simulations as **\*.qpr1** or **\*.qpr2** files (*sometimes those files are not explicitly needed, for example if results re automatically exported and the user wants to reduce disk memory consumption during very large batch runs*).

	**remove_wind**
	
The parameter :code:`remove_wind` removes the binary windfield files (\*.bts), that may be automatically generated when a simulation definition file (\*.sim) is evaluated. This can be useful to reduce disk memory usage during very large batch runs.

	**skip**
	
Adding the parameter :code:`skip` causes QBlade to skip the evaluation of a simulation (\*.sim) or project (\*.qpr) file if an assocated finished project file (\*.qpr1) already exists, or if the results from this simulation have already been exported previously.

	**exp_h2bin**
	
The parameter :code:`` adds the HAWC2 binary format to the list of export formats. Whenever a simulation is completed the results of this simulation will be automatically exported for all specified formats. As default no format is specified, so auto-export if disabled.
	
	**exp_h2ascii**
	
The parameter :code:`` adds the HAWC2 ASCII format to the list of export formats. Whenever a simulation is completed the results of this simulation will be automatically exported for all specified formats. As default no format is specified, so auto-export if disabled.

	**exp_ascii**
	
The parameter :code:`` adds the ASCII format to the list of export formats. Whenever a simulation is completed the results of this simulation will be automatically exported for all specified formats. As default no format is specified, so auto-export if disabled.

	**exp_cut_txt**
	
The parameter :code:`exp_cut_txt` adds the cut-plane TXT format to the list of export formats. Whenever a cut-plane is evaluated, its velocity field will be automatically exported for all specified formats. As default no format is specified, so auto-export if disabled.

	**exp_cut_vtu**
	
The parameter :code:`exp_cut_vtu` adds the cut-plane VTU format to the list of export formats. Whenever a cut-plane is evaluated, its velocity field will be automatically exported for all specified formats. As default no format is specified, so auto-export if disabled.

	**post_exp**
	
The parameter :code:`post_exp` causes QBlade to automatically export the results from all finished project files (\*.qpr, \*.qpr1, \*.qpr2) in all WORKING_DIR(s). This parameter only affects simulations that are already finished when the CLI call is executed and not simulations that are being evaluated during the CLI call. Simulations are exported in all formats that have been added to the export format list.

	**post_cut**
	
The parameter :code:`post_cut` causes QBlade to automatically calculate all cut-plane definitions from the cut-plane definition list for all finished project files (\*.qpr, \*.qpr1) in all WORKING_DIR(s). This parameter only affects simulations that are already finished when the CLI call is executed and not simulations that are being evaluated during the CLI call. Cut-planes are exported in all formats that have been added to the export format list.

Sample CLI Call to Start a Batch Run
************************************

The following call is an example for a CLI call of QBlade to evaluate and automatically export a batch of simulation definition files located in the folder c:\\simulations\\.

	:code:`QBladeEE -cmd -d1 -g64 -t12 c:\simulations\ all_sim exp_h2bin remove_wind skip`
	
After this CLI call QBlade will evaluate all simulation definitions (:code:`all_sim`) located in c:\\simulations\\ over 12 parallel threads (:code:`-t12`). OpenCL device 1 will be used (:code:`-d1`) with a work-group size of 64 (:code:`-g64`). The simulation results will automatically be exported to the HAWC2 binary format (:code:`exp_h2bin`). Simulations that have already been evaluated previously will be skipped (:code:`skip`) and the automatically generated binary wind fields will be removed after a simulation is finished (:code:`remove_wind`). Upon this call the following info is printed out on the screen::
